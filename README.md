# Metamorphic Contract

A metamorphic contract is a type of smart contract that can change or evolve over time while retaining its original functionality and properties. They are more flexible and adaptable than traditional smart contracts and can be useful in situations where contract requirements are likely to change over time. However, they also present some unique challenges and risks, particularly around security and transparency, and should be carefully evaluated before deployment.
